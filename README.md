# Data-Manipulation-Of-Book-Records
It was the project of Data Structures implemented in c++ language in which I managed around 1GB dataset of books containing 20 attributes (implementation in c++)

FEATURES :

1) Searching 
2) Sorting
3) Filtering
4)Suggestions based on user inputs e.t.c

Best algorithms of minimum time complexity were used along with linear and non linear data structures
